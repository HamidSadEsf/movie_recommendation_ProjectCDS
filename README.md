#Hybrid Movie Recommendation System

In this project we developed a weighted and switching hybrid movie recommendation system by means of combining two distinct approaches to developing a recommender - a content-based and user-based collaborative filtering. The goal is to determine and recommend a given amount of movies for each user in the dataset with the aim to sustain and increase the userâ€™s engagement with the recommendation platform. The latter is hoped to be achieved through building a diverse and personalized recommendation system based on user rating history (collaborative filtering), analysis of the items features (content-based) and handling of the cold-start problem.
