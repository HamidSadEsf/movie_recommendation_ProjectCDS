By integrating different methods, hybrid recommender systems aim to overcome the limitations and weaknesses of individual recommendation techniques, resulting in improved recommendation quality. While the details of implementation may differ between various players, such companies as Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, LinkedIn, Youtube and others use hybrid recommenders.''')

This represents a rather straightforward and simple implementation of a hybrid recommender system, which becomes evident when we compare our system's structure to a more sophisticated one, as exemplified by Netflix, for instance.''')
